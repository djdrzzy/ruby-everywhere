ruby-everywhere
===============

Execute ruby code anywhere on your mac

How does it work?
-----------------

It's a simple automator action that will install itself as a service and allow you to execute arbitrary ruby code in any text editor (and probably other places) on your mac.

What else can it do?
--------------------

You can add heavily used ruby code to a '~/.ruby-everywhere' file that is loaded every time you execute the service. You can then use that code anywhere on your mac to see the output.

Anything to make it easier?
---------------------------

You can assign it to a keyboard shortcut. Easiest way to do that is to go to the 'Keyboard' settings in 'System Preferences', click on the 'Shortcuts' tab, select the 'Services' item in the list on the left, find the 'ruby-everywhere' service and then assign a keyboard shortcut to it.
